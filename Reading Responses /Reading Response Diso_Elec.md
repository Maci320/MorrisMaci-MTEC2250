Wasn't sure exactly what to say for the response...

Disobedient Electronics is exactly what I imagined it would be from the title. It highlighted many pieces that further either a feminist view  or intersectionality. The lack of women in tech is still a real issue in 2018. This compellation illuminated the work that is being done by women in the tech sphere for activism causes and general tech advancement. 

Specific pieces I enjoyed: Abortion Drone, 79% work clock, Mixed Messages Bra


The possible usefulness of these inventions to people in third world countries was inspiring 
Specific pieces: Panic Button, Offline Network


and well Dissenting Jabots was just too much for me so I shared it with a friend who also is a fan of dear Ruth Ginsburg

All in all great piece that gives a lot to consider in creating tech that can make an impact outside of being spectacular fun
