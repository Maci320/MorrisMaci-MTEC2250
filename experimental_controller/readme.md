experimental controller


To be honest this is probably the worst thing I've ever created. My intention was to use the soft potentiometer. I wanted to make a polygon shapped controller where the user presses their finger at different degrees and depending on the degree one of two lights would light up. The lights would be a red and green led for go and stop.
